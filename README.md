# Toolbox

Toolbox provides a standard set of build tools to help bootstrap infrastructure
projects. Toolbox is published as a [Docker image][01] and a [Makefile library][02]
that can be included into your projects to help ensure a consistent and reproducable
build experience.

## Features

- Standard build tool image containing Terraform, AWS CLI, Snyk, Shellcheck, etc
- Simplifies Terraform workspace configuration and management
- Auto-generation of Buildkite pipelines
- Make targets provide a consistent/reproducable way of invoking build tooling

## Getting Started

To use Toolbox, download the latest released version of [toolbox.mk][02] from the
[releases][03] page into the root of your project. The following Bash script will
do the same thing.

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/seek-oss/toolbox/releases/latest \
  | jq -r '.assets[0].browser_download_url' \
  | xargs curl -Lso toolbox.mk
```

Then, include `toolbox.mk` from your project's Makefile.

```makefile
# Makefile
include toolbox.mk
```

You can now run `make help` to show the available Toolbox commands. Most of the
commands require a Toolbox configuration file which is described below.

To keep Toolbox up to date, you can run `make toolbox-upgrade` to install the
latest released version.

To use Toolbox to generate your Buildkite pipeline update your `.buildkite/pipeline.yaml`
file to call `make buildkite-pipeline`.

```yaml
steps:
- label: ":buildkite: Create pipeline"
  command: "make buildkite-pipeline | buildkite-agent pipeline upload"
```

## Configuration

Each project that uses Toolbox needs to define a configuration file that tells
Toolbox about your project. Toolbox will search for a configuration file in the
root of your project in the following order of names: `toolbox.yaml`, `toolbox.yml`,
`.toolbox.yaml`, `.toolbox.yml`. You can use the environment variable
`TOOLBOX_CONFIG_FILE` if you want to use a custom file path.

An example annotated configuration file is shown below. The schema can be found
[here][04].

```yaml
# (Optional)
# Terraform configuration section.
terraform:
  # (Optional)
  # Terraform linting section. This section configures the behaviour of the
  # `terraform fmt` command.
  lint:
    # (Optional)
    # Buildkite queue that is targetted by the lint operation. If this queue is omitted,
    # the lint operation is excluded from the Buildkite pipeline.
    queue: development

  # (Optional)
  # Terraform validation section. This section configures the behaviour of the
  # `terraform validate` command.
  validate:
    # (Optional) Buildkite queue that is targetted by the validate operation. If this
    # queue is omitted, the validate operation is excluded from the Buildkite pipeline.
    queue: development

  # (Optional)
  # Terraform workspace configuration section.
  # Each Terraform workspace represents a deployent target that can be planned and applied.
  workspaces:
  - # (Required)
    # Name of the workspace. This must be unique within the array of workspaces.
    name: us-west-1-development
    # (Optional)
    # Path to the variables file that corresponds to this workspace.
    var_file: config/us-west-1/development.tfvars
    # (Optional)
    # ID of the AWS account that this workspace is deployed to. This field is used to protect
    # against being authenticated against the wrong account. If this field is omitted, this
    # safety check will not be performed.
    aws_account_id: "111111111111"
    # (Optional)
    # Buildkite queue that is targetted by the Terraform operations on this workspace.
    # If this queue is omitted, this workspace will be excluded from the Buildkite pipeline.
    queue: development
    # (Optional)
    # Whether this workspace corresponds to a production environment. This field is used to
    # order deployments within the Buildkite pipeline so that non-production workspaces are
    # deployed before production workspaces.
    is_production: false
    # (Optional)
    # Array of branch names that may be deployed using this workspace. If this property is
    # not specified, only branches named "main" or "master" will result in a deployment.
    branches:
    - sandbox

# (Optional)
# Shell script configuration section.
shell:
  (Optional)
  # Shell linting section. This section configures the behaviour of the shellcheck and shfmt
  # commands which can either be run indendently via `make shell-shellcheck` and `make-shfmt`,
  # respectively, or together via `make shell-lint`.
  lint:
    # (Optional)
    # Buildkite queue that is targetted by the lint operation (that runs both shellcheck and shfmt).
    # If this queue is omitted, the lint operation is excluded from the Buildkite pipeline.
    queue: development

# (Optional)
# Snyk configuration section.
snyk:
  # (Required)
  # Name of the Snyk organisation to which projects should be assigned.
  org: my-org
  # (Required)
  # ID of the AWS secret that holds the Snyk API token.
  secret_id: snyk/api-token
  # (Optional)
  # Snyk application test section.
  app_test:
    # (Optional)
    # Buildkite queue that is targetted by the application test operation. If this queue is omitted,
    # Snyk application tests will be excluded from the Buildkite pipeline.
    queue: development
    # (Optional)
    # Whether the application test should run in "warning mode" and always pass so as not to block
    # the Buildkite pipeline. Defaults to false.
    always_pass: false

  # (Optional)
  # Snyk infrastructure test section.
  iac_test:
    # (Optional)
    # Buildkite queue that is targetted by the application test operation. If this queue is omitted,
    # Snyk application tests will be excluded from the Buildkite pipeline.
    queue: development
    # (Optional)
    # Whether the application test should run in "warning mode" and always pass so as not to block
    # the Buildkite pipeline. Defaults to false.
    always_pass: false

# (Optional)
# Buildkite configuration section.
buildkite:
  # (Optional)
  # Whether Buildkite should block or wait between certain Terraform steps. This will apply between
  # the plan steps and the apply steps, as well as between apply steps for non-production workspaces
  # and production workspaces. If specified, the value of this property must be either "block" or
  # "wait". The default is to block.
  deploy_pause_type: block
  # (Optional)
  # Buildkite artifact management section. This section determines how the Buildkite artifacts plugin
  # (https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/artifacts-buildkite-plugin) should be configured for Terraform
  # plan and apply steps. The "from" and "to" properties below may make use of the ${workspace} variable
  # which will be replaced with the name of the Terraform workspace associated with the upload/download.
  artifacts:
  - # (Required)
    # The type of steps that should download and/or upload these artifacts. Acceptable values are "plan"
    # and "apply".
